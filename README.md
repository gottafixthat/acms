Another Content Management System

Another Content Management System (ACMS) takes a very different approach to traditional CMS systems.

The entire system is based on abstract objects or "chunks" of data. Each data type has a handler and pages are constructed by referencing different types of chunks that are combined to create pages. The idea is to never repeat the same data twice and call everything by reference, creating pages using a wiki-like syntax.
